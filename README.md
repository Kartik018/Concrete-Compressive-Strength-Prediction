# Concrete-Compressive-Strength-Prediction

The quality of concrete is determined by its compressive strength, which is measured using a conventional crushing test on a concrete cylinder. The strength of the concrete is also a vital aspect in achieving the requisite longevity. It will take 28 days to test strength, which is a long period. So, what will we do now? We can save a lot of time and effort by using Data Science to estimate how much quantity of which raw material we need for acceptable compressive strength. 

It predicts the Concrete Compressive Strength depending upon raw material

The main objective of the project is to create a web application which takes some inputs from users and based on the information predicts the premium amount.

A glance of the web application is furnished below:
