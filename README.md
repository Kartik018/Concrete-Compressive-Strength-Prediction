# Concrete-Compressive-Strength-Prediction

Abstract: Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The
concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and
ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash,
water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.
